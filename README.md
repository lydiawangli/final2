# This project aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 across different demographics, focusing on the United States. It seeks to uncover correlations between pre-existing health conditions and COVID-19 related fatalities. The analysis utilizes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which includes detailed records on COVID-19 fatalities, demographic data, and comorbid conditions.

# The dataset could be downloaded from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/conditions-contributing-to-deaths-involving-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-by-age-group or found in the folder called "data".
